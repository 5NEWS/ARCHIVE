CG â€” or Chandrila Group has announced today the purchase of the remaining shares of Chandrila DataTech (CDT), the Inner & Core worlds largest data-pad and holocomm manufacturer from the Chandrilan Government. CG previously maintained a 75% share of the corporation, which sells its consumer technology across much of the free Inner and Core worlds. 

"Since its inception CDT has been an excellent manufacturer of high-quality data-pads and holocomm technology, providing access to information to billions across the universe." said Anela Jarek, CG Chief Executive Officer. "The decision to purchase the remaining shares was a result of eliminating the risk of having an external share-holder". Ms. Jarek has been open in regards to her sceptical view of the Chandrilan Government.

CG has refused to disclose the figure it has paid for the remaining shares, stating that the transaction is still awaiting regulatory approval.
